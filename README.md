# C# OOP & SOLID Principles: A Turn-Based Duel Simulator

This console application is a hands-on project designed to demonstrate a deep, practical understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and the five SOLID design principles. It simulates a turn-based duel between two fantasy characters, where the focus is not on the game itself, but on the quality, maintainability, and extensibility of the underlying code.

This project serves as a portfolio piece to showcase the ability to write C# code.

## Key Design & Architectural Patterns

This project intentionally uses specific design patterns and architectural decisions to create a robust and flexible system.

### Data-Driven Design
A core principle of this project is to define game content as data, not as code. This is a modern approach that allows for rapid content expansion without modifying core application logic.
*   **Abilities & Items:** Instead of creating a separate class for every ability (`Fireball`, `Ice Barrier`) and item (`Frostmourne`, `The One Ring`), they are defined as instances of a single, concrete `Ability` and `Item` class. This makes the system incredibly extensibleâ€”adding 20 new items is as simple as adding 20 new lines to a list, with no new classes required.
*   **Damage Modifiers:** Class-vs-class advantages (e.g., "Warrior is strong against Assassin") are not hard-coded with `if/else` statements. Instead, each class defines its own weaknesses and resistances in a `DamageModifiers` dictionary. This logic is applied generically by the central combat engine.

### SOLID Principles in Action

*   **[S] Single Responsibility Principle:** Each class has a single, well-defined purpose. The `Duel` class manages the combat flow, `AbstractClass` and its children manage their own state, and the `InputHandler` manages user interaction.
*   **[O] Open/Closed Principle:** The system is open for extension but closed for modification. You can add a new `Paladin` class, 50 new abilities, or 100 new items without changing any of the existing, tested code in the core combat or character classes.
*   **[L] Liskov Substitution Principle:** All character classes inherit from `AbstractClass`. The `Duel` engine can work with any two `AbstractClass` objects, treating them identically without needing to know their concrete types (`Warrior`, `Mage`, etc.).
*   **[I] Interface Segregation Principle:** Interfaces are kept small and focused (e.g., `IClassInterface`).
*   **[D] Dependency Inversion Principle:** High-level modules like `Duel` depend on abstractions (`AbstractClass`), not on low-level concrete classes (`Warrior`). This decouples the system and allows for greater flexibility.

## Tech Stack

*   **Language:** C#
*   **Framework:** .NET
*   **Platform:** Console Application

## Code Structure Overview

*   **/Classes:** Contains the `AbstractClass` base class and concrete implementations like `Warrior`, `Mage`, and `Assassin`.
*   **/Abilities:** Contains the data-driven `Ability` class.
*   **/Items:** Contains the data-driven `Item` class.
*   **/Combat:** Contains the `Duel` class, which orchestrates the entire simulation.
*   **/Interfaces:** Contains the core abstractions for the project.
*   **/UserInputs:** Contains the `InputHandler` responsible for all console interaction.
*   **Program.cs:** The application's entry point, responsible for composing the objects and starting the simulation.
